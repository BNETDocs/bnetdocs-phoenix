<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Google reported malware on the bnetdocs.org site and I had to
remove everything that was under this directory.</p>
<p>If I hadn't removed everything here, Google would display a malware warning
to visitors of the site, which would have been a big problem.</p>
<p>Please see <a href="http://bhfiles.com/files/">http://bhfiles.com/files/</a>
for any content you would have found here. This directory was just a mirror of
that site.</p>
<p>Best,</p>

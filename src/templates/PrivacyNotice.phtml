    <h2><a id="what-data-is-collected"><strong>What data is collected?</strong></a></h2>

      <li>The IP address, user agent, and requested Url of all clients accessing the site, used for logging and tracking of actions on the site.</li>
      <li>A person's email address, used for User account identification on the site and for authentication.</li>
      <li>A User account password, used for authentication.</li>
      <li>Social media information, optionally given by the User and not necessary for the function of the site.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h2><a id="how-is-your-data-collected"><strong>How is your data collected?</strong></a></h2>
    <p>You directly provide <?=$org?> with most of the data that is collected. <?=$org?> collects data and processes data when you:</p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>Create a User account on the site, or modify your User profile on the site.</li>
      <li>Submit, post, or upload media and/or content to the site.</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h2><a id="how-will-your-data-be-used"><strong>How will your data be used?</strong></a></h2>

    <h2><a id="how-is-your-data-stored"><strong>How is your data stored?</strong></a></h2>
    <p><?=$org?> uses a relational database schema hosted in <?=filter_var($data_location, FILTER_SANITIZE_FULL_SPECIAL_CHARS)?>. The full system is backed up via machine snapshots, and the data is not accessible without two-factor authentication. A firewall exists between the online database and the rest of the Internet, which by its nature prevents any unknown traffic from reaching the data. Database backups are created at regular intervals via cronjob or similar automated processes, and the backups are uploaded to an authenticated third-party redundant location.</p>
